# About
This is a bot to play universal paperclips. It runs for a while, and does simple stuff such as buying wire, adjusting price, and buying upgrades,
However, beyond that, the bot isn't able to finish the game yet.

# Running
To run the bot, first go to https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/ and click on the box of paperclips to begin the game.
Then, copy the code in bot.js and paste it into your browser's developer console. Hit enter and the bot should now begin running.
